# My Notes on Concurrency

Threads, Tasks and Processes are same on the high level, but when we dig deeper we can observe the differences.

Multiprocessing literally runs all of the tasks at the same time. 

Threading and asyncio both run on a single processor.

p.s. I feel like i am more interested in Multiprocessing.

The need for concurrency arises in the following two situations-

1) I/O Bound Processes

2) CPU Bound Processes
