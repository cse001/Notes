# 26 Weeks of Data Science

## Week 1

#### Dear Learner,

A humble welcome into the **26-Weeks-Of-Data-Science** study plan from team **GreyAtom**. We at GreyAtom, have trained 1000s of professionals from a multitude of backgrounds and know exactly what it takes to be a data scientist and how to make you one. For a motivated learner like you, in these 26 weeks, you should be able to **make steady strides in the discipline of Data Science**. In these 26 weeks, you’d be receiving one email from us per week, each of them equipped with the following resources:

1. **Jupyter Notebooks** with code snippets relevant to the pertaining topic dedicated for the week
2. Bonus materials from industry experts to upskill your understanding on the topic and help you see in new light
3. **Cheatsheets** for every topic to help you think in the nick of time
4. Reality anchoring tips - once per week - to keep you focussed on the common goal.
5. **Access to career resources** to help fine tune your approach to the market and make you market ready.



Below is a brief description of what a learner can expect from this study plan:

- The initial weeks would lay the foundations in **programming** & **statistics** on which we would model our study on machine learning.
- We'd start off with a primer on Git followed by the basics of Object Oriented programming in Python. Following this we'll slowly advance into **Numpy**, **Pandas** and **Visualizations**
- Once we get a tight hold on Python, we'll venture into **statistics** and **exploratory data analysis** which would involve a lot of the python and visualization skills we'd learnt previously, to make the data ready for applying machine learning models.
- In the middle of the course you’ll learn about the supervised algorithms like **Linear Regression**, **Logistic Regression**,**Decision Trees**,**Random Forests** etc, and unsupervised ones like **K-Means Clustering** and a few more, how to implement them from scratch and how to use them for prediction tasks etc.
- In addition to our notebooks, the **bonus materials** in accordance to the respective topics will serve you well by giving you the industry perspective of machine learning.
- Towards the end of the course, we’ll delve a little into **Natural Language Processing** & **Recommender Systems** and make you adept at how to apply your machine learning knowledge for real world applications.

## 1.Prerequisites

There are a few pre-requisites to begin with, some installations to be done before we start.

1. Anaconda

   You would have to download and install Anaconda[ Download Anaconda](http://e-in21.gtolink.in/t/em/29908/1/4fb34f18-3322-4037-82de-c187ab4b20db/277) Anaconda is the stage where all our Machine Learning magic is supposed to happen. So let's set the stage right! Refer Here[Here is the step-by-step guide](http://e-in21.gtolink.in/t/em/29908/1/4fb34f18-3322-4037-82de-c187ab4b20db/278)

2. **Git**

   You can download it here[ Download Git](http://e-in21.gtolink.in/t/em/29908/1/4fb34f18-3322-4037-82de-c187ab4b20db/279)

3. **Machine Configuration**

   Minimum system requirements for the laptop to be used during the course - 64 bit system, minimum 4 GB RAM, i3 and above processor. You can use either the Mac OS or Ubuntu 16.04 while working through the study plan. A note on hardware: your machine should have the amd64 architecture. If you are not using an ancient machine, you should be fine. If you are using Windows, [click here](http://e-in21.gtolink.in/t/em/29908/1/4fb34f18-3322-4037-82de-c187ab4b20db/286)

## 2. Git Basics and Introduction to Python

Git is a modern widely-used distributed version control system where every user’s working copy has a complete history of changes. It’s a mature and an open-source project, developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux).

Our content on git and Python starts from level zero and marches on to explain all the nitty gritties of it in unique fashion but it is also advised for you to implement the commands and code yourself to get a good grasp on them.

We like bringing in a change for the good in the lives of our learners. We take pride in putting our heart and soul into crafting every learner and help him understand the broader underpinnings of what it takes to be a data scientist and make that transition into one,thereby leaving a drastic impact in his life. You as an online learner won't be an exception.In today's video we have **Varun Panicker**, currently a student at the **University Of Washington at Seattle**, one of our past learners, sharing his experience at GreyAtom.Do watch what he has to say.4.

It is for this that we have curated a special set of videos to not let you distract yourself or lose hope. I'm sure you'll be in good light after watching them. Do refer an article for extra motivation[ here](http://e-in21.gtolink.in/t/em/29908/1/4fb34f18-3322-4037-82de-c187ab4b20db/283)5. CHEATSHEET :: Topic in a nutshellIt is rightly said that you can't explain it well enough unless you've explained it to a 5-yr old. Try explaining today's content. Feeling a little dizzy right! It is hence that we provide you a **cheatsheet** to help make a mindmap of what you've learnt so far. With this do feel confident enough in recollecting stuff ![DOWNLOAD YOUR CHEATSHEET HERE](http://e-in21.gtolink.in/t/em/29908/1/4fb34f18-3322-4037-82de-c187ab4b20db/300)
